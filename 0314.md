# Enter the Data

## Enter Selections

What if you don't know how much data you have?

An enter selection is the set of dat aelements that do not have an associated html element

```javascript
var info = [57, 239, 2];
var container = d3.select("svg");
circles = container.selectAll("circle").data(info).enter();
```

`circles` is now an array of 3 objects with associated adata

`circles.append("circle")`
