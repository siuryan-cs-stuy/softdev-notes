# Capturing Bubbles

## Event Propagation
1. An element intercepts an event
2. Browser collects DOM node path of the event from the starting element to the root
3. Capture: the event propagates down the path from step 2
4. Bubble: the event propagates up the path from step 2

By default, event listeners do not trigger until the bubbling phase
Triggering events at the capture phase can be done by adding `true` as a third argument to `addEventListener`.

```
x.addEventListener("click", foo, true)
```

You can cancel event propagation with `e.stopPropagation()`
