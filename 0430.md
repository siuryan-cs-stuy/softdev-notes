# How Functiony is your Python?

## map/filter
- Programming structures designed to manipulate lists
- Preferred method is to use list comprehensions

### map

Create a list by applying a function to each element in an existing list.

```python
map(<function>, list)
```

### filter

Create a list by filtering out elements of an existing list.

## lambda expressions
- Anonymous function creation in python
- Similar to `lambda` in racket and `function` in javascript

Syntax
```python
lambda arguments : expression
```
- Expression must return a value; `return` is not used

```python
lambda x : 2*x
lambda a, b : a if a > b else b
```

## reduce

Compute a single value based on a list.

```python
reduce( function, list )
```
- The function argument must take 2 parameters
- They represent the previously computed value and the next element in the list

```python
reduce( lambda a, b: a + b, [49, 37, 163, 2])
reduce( lambda a, b: a if a > b else b, [49, 37, 163, 2])
```
