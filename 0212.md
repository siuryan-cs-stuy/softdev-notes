# Documenting Your Data

## NoSQL Databases
- Non table-based (relational) databases
- Relational datbase (perhaps not SQL based) are most commonly used, but NoSQL have become more popular with the advancement of 21st century web applications and big data

### Examples
- __Key-value__: Database is essentially a large dictionary
- __Graph__: Database is stored as a graph, where relationships between the data nodes are essential to the database schema
- __Document__: Database is a collection of documents, which can contain various amounts and types of data


## Document Databases
- A single record in the document database is a _document_
- Documents contain fields and values (like a dictionary)
- You do not need to specify types for the values
- A group of documents is put into a collection
- Documents do not need to be stored on the same storage device
- MongoDB is a popular document database

### MongoDB Example

```
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("54c955492b7c8eb21818bd09"),
    "address" : {
        "street" : "2 Avenue",
        "zipcode" : "10075",
        "building" : "1480",
        "coord" : [ -73.9557413, 40.7720266 ]
    },
    "borough" : "Manhattan",
    "cuisine" : "Italian",
    "grades" : [
        {
            "date" : ISODate("2014-10-01T00:00:00Z"),
            "grade" : "A",
            "score" : 11
        },
        {
            "date" : ISODate("2014-01-16T00:00:00Z"),
            "grade" : "B",
            "score" : 17
        }
    ],
    "name" : "Vella",
    "restaurant_id" : "41704620"
}
```
