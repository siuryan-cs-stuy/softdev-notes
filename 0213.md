# Hey Mon, Go Get Some Data

## Working with MongoDB
- MongoDB uses a separate database server, as opposed to sqlite, which uses a file to store the entire database (most SQL tools are also server based)
- The `mongod` server process runs on one machine, and can potentially contain multiple separate databases
- `mongo` client processes, possibly on different machines, communicate with the server
- There are libraries for various programming languages to communicate with a mongod server (python: pymongo)

### Using the Mongo Shell

#### Connecting to a server
```bash
$ mongo <server>
```
Server should be an IP address

#### Shell Commands

- `show dbs`: Show databases
- `db`: Shows current database
- `use <db>`: Switches to specified database
  - Mongo does not commit a new database until something is added to it
- `show collections`: Shows collections in a database

##### Inserting a document
```
db.<collection>.insert({<field>: <value>})
```
- Adds document in specified collection
- Will create collection if it doesn't exist
- _id will be automatically added

##### Removing a collection
```
db.<collection>.drop()
```

##### Removing the current database
```
db.dropDatabase()
```

---

#### Querying MongoDB
```
db.<collection>.find( query document )
```
- `query documents` define a database query
  - `{ query key: desired value }`

This `query documents` can find all values where name is 'bob':
`{ "name" : "bob" }`

AND is implied by having multiple keys in the query document
`{ "name" : "bob", "age" : 27 }`

##### Query Documents
Comparison operators are dictionaries that modify the value of the query codument

| Operator | Mongo Equivalent |
|----------|------------------|
| <        | $lt              |
| >        | $gt              |
| <=       | $lte             |
| >=       | $gte             |
| !=       | $ne              |

```
{ "id" : {$lt : 400} }
```

OR is a dictionary with list as values

```
{ $or : [{ "name" : "bob" }, { "id" : {$lt : 400} }]}
```

Use `.` to query a list of embedded documents

```
{ "projects.grades" : 90 }
```
