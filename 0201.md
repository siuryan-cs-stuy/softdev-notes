# Canvasing the Area

## HTML5
- Redesign of HTML with a focus on making the more "modern" features of web browsers easy to work with
- Designed around javascript and a standardized DOM
- Includes built in support for audio and video playback
  - `<audio>` and `<video>`
- Includes an element that can be drawn directly on
  - `<canvas>`

## Canvas
- HTML5 element that provides a drawing area
- Javascript functions can draw onto a canvas element
  - You must declare in what context you are drawing
    - 3D drawing, 2D, raw bitmap, others...

### Basic Canvas Operation

#### HTML

```html
<canvas height="500" width="500" id="slate">
Any text here is only displayed if the canvas is not recognized by the browser.
</canvas>
```

#### Javascript
```javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById("slate");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

// Draw 200x100 rectangle at (0, 100)
ctx.fillRect(0, 100, 200, 100);

// Set color of draw to "lightsteelblue"
ctx.fillStyle = "lightsteelblue";

// Draw 200x100 "lightsteelblue" rectangle at (0, 100)
ctx.fillRect(0, 100, 200, 100);
```

##### Notes
- Origin is at the top left corner
- No layering; canvas coordinates are overwritten
