Databases and collections can be accessed using [] or .

```

#### Adding databases, collections, documents
- There is no specific command for creating databases and collections
- Once a document is added to a collection, the associated database and collection are created if they did no already exist

Add `document` to `collection`
```python

```
`_id` will be created by mongo for the document

Add each document in `document list` to `collection`
```python
<collection>.insert_many( document list )
```
