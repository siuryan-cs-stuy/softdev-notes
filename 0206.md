# Getting Animated

## Functions

```javascript
window.setInterval( func, time )
```
- js function that calls func every time milliseconds

```javascript
window.requestAnimationFrame( func )
```
- Tells the browser to run func before drawing the next frame
- The browser will attempt to run ~60 frames per second
- Lets the browser handle when the code should be executed (as opposed to setInterval which is based on time)
- Lets the browser pause animation when a page is not in the foreground
- Returns a number used to identify the frame that *will be painted* (`requestID`)

```javascript
window.cancelAnimationFrame( requestID )
```
- Cancels drawing the frame identified by `requestID`
