# What's your vector victor?

## XML
- eXtensible Markup Language
- Not a formatting language (like HTML)
- A framework for creating markup based grammars
- Uses some of the syntatic standards of HTML, like tags and attributes, with a focus on storing and representing data instead of rendering and displaying it
- An XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with a specific XML language

## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- SVG is a specific XML based vector graphics format
- Vector graphics are images that are not represented as a 2D grid of pixels (raster) but insttead as a lsit of drawing commands (like line, circle, rectangle, curve...)
- The `<svg>` element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)

```
